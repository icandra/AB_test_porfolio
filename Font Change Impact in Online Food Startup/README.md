## Project Description
This time, I got an opportunity to assist a startup that sells food products online. 
The UI and UX designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.

## Objective
This analysis's ultimate goal is to check whether changing the font will affect user behavior, particularly the conversion rate. Also, we will present funnel analysis to see if there is any improvement area we can do.

## Method
Here are the analysis steps:
 1. STAGE 1 - Get Started
 2. STAGE 2 - Data Preprocessing
 3. STAGE 3 - Funnel Analysis
 4. STAGE 4 - Hypoteses Testing
 
 All the analysis will be based on user experience (events) while using the apps.

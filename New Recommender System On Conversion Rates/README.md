## Project Description
In this analysis, I delved into evaluating the impact of a new recommender system implemented in an international online store to improve conversion rates. The test named recommender_system_test involved two groups - Group A (control) and Group B (new payment funnel). <br>
<br>
Within 14 days of signing up, I needed to analyze whether users demonstrated improved conversion into:<br>
(1) product page views<br>
(2) product card views<br>
(3) purchases<br>
<br>
At each stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, we expect to observe a minimum 10% increase in conversion rates.
This project presented unique challenges as I analyzed data from a previous data analyst who had resigned. <br>
<br>
I discovered that the dataset obtained did not fully align with the technical project description, and the test coincided with the Christmas and New Year holidays, potentially introducing bias into the results. 

## Statistical Analysis & Tools:
To conduct this project, I utilized several Python libraries.<br>
I also applied statistical tests such as two proportion Z-test, Shapiro-Wilk test, power analysis, and Mann-Whitney U test.

## Project May 2023 | [Analyzing the Impact of a New Recommender System on Conversion Rates: A Comparative A/B Test Analysis in an International Online Store](https://github.com/icandra/AB_test_portfolio/tree/main/New%20Recommender%20System%20On%20Conversion%20Rates)

In this analysis, I evaluated the impact of a new recommender system implemented in an international online store with the goal of improving conversion rates. The test involved two groups - Group A (control) and Group B (new payment funnel). Within a 14-day period, I analyzed user behavior to determine if there was an increase in conversion rates for product page views, product card views, and purchases at each stage of the funnel. The project required overcoming unique challenges, including discrepancies in the dataset compared to the project description and potential bias introduced by the Christmas and New Year holidays during the test period. I conducted statistical analysis using Python libraries and applied tests such as two proportion Z-test, Shapiro-Wilk test, power analysis, and Mann-Whitney U test.

## Project March 2023 | [Font Change Impact: A Comprehensive A/A/B Test Analysis for an Online Food Startup](https://github.com/icandra/AB_test_portfolio/tree/main/Font%20Change%20Impact%20in%20Online%20Food%20Startup)

In this project, I had the opportunity to assist a startup engaged in selling food products online. The task involved addressing concerns from UI and UX designers who wanted to change the fonts for the entire app but were apprehensive about user acceptance. To make an informed decision, an A/A/B test was conducted. The analysis aimed to determine whether the font change would impact user behavior, particularly the conversion rate. Additionally, funnel analysis was presented to identify potential areas for improvement. The entire analysis was based on user experience events while using the app, helping the startup make data-driven decisions for enhancing their platform.

## Project March 2023 | [Maximizing Online Store Profits: A Data-driven A/B Testing Exploration](https://github.com/icandra/AB_test_portfolio/tree/main/AB%20Testing%20Exploration%20for%20Maximizing%20Online%20Store%20Profits)

In collaboration with the marketing department of a significant online store, this project aimed to increase revenue through a series of hypotheses testing. The analysis focused on prioritizing hypotheses, evaluating A/B testing results, and determining whether to continue or halt the tests. Divided into three sections, the analysis encompassed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) for cumulative revenue, average order size, conversion rate, number of orders per user, and order prices. The project successfully identified key insights to improve revenue generation strategies
